--- Now performing some analysis on the created schema on performance and report csv file ---
1) List all agents names ??
select agent_name from report_table_orc 
union 
select agent_name from performance_table_orc;

2) Find out agent average rating ??
select 
  agent_name , avg(average_rating) as avg_rating
from 
  performance_table_orc
group by 
  agent_name ;

3) Total working days for each agents ??
select 
  agent_name , count(date) 
from 
  report_table_orc
group by 
  agent_name ;

4) Total feedback that each agent have got ??
select 
  agent_name , sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback
from 
  performance_table_orc
group by 
  agent_name ;

5) Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4 ??
select 
  distinct agent_name 
from 
  performance_table_orc 
where 
  average_rating between 3.5 and 4 ;

6) Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 ??
select 
  distinct agent_name 
from 
  performance_table_orc 
where 
  average_rating < 3.5;

7) Agent name who have rating more than 4.5 ??
select 
  distinct agent_name 
from 
  performance_table_orc 
where 
  average_rating >  4.5 ;

8) How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average ??
select 
  agent_name , sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback 
from 
  performance_table_orc 
where 
  average_rating >  4.5 
group by 
  agent_name;

9) Perform inner join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your
local system ??


10) Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning for report file ??
create external table report_table_partition 
(
id int,
agent_name string,
date date,
login timestamp,
logout timestamp,
duration timestamp
)
partitioned by (file_name string ,name string)
clustered by (duration)
sorted by (duration)
into 2 buckets 
row format delimited 
fields terminated by '|'
stored as textfile;

insert into table report_table_partition partition(file_name = 'report' , name) 
select a.*, agent_name from report_table_orc as a;
